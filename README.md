# NotePad--
### What is it?
Notepad-- is a basic plain text file editor similar to a text editor like notepad (on windows). 

### Why does it exist?
Originally I just wanted practice at making a simple desktop application and chose a plain text editor because it was an area I had practice in before (having basically made this same thing as a console application). Now it has a genuine purpose. Microsoft's notepad app is has changed recently and added quite a couple features that annoy me to no end, they've added a tabs system so a single notepad instance can hold multiple files, and the saving is really weird and annoying and closing it is just a hassle. Its a mess. It's actually a really well made app but shut up-

On top of that I want to use this as an opportunity to both make this a fully feature complete program, as I plan to use it personally, and set up proper testing since the amount of features will be small, making it a nice simple way to learn those processes.
